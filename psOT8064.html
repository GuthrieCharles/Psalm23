<h5>OT:8064  shamayim (shaw-mah'-yim)</h5>
<p> Dual of an unused singular shameh (shaw-meh'); from an unused root meaning to be lofty; the sky (as aloft; the dual perhaps alluding to the visible arch in which the clouds move, as well as to the higher ether where the celestial bodies revolve):
</p>
<p>KJV - air, astrologer, heaven (-s).</p>
