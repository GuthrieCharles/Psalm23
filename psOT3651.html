    <h5>OT:3651 ken (kane);</h5>
    <p>From OT:3559; properly, set upright; hence (figuratively as adjective) just; but usually (as adverb or
        conjunction) rightly or so (in various applications to manner, time and relation; often with other particles):
    </p>

    <p>KJV - after that (this, -ward, -wards), as ... as, [for-] asmuch as yet, be (for which) cause, following,
        howbeit, in (the) like (manner, -wise), the more, right, (even) so, state, straightway, such (thing), surely,
        there (wherefore)-, this, thus, true, well, you.</p>
